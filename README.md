## 🧪 Testing

Unit + integration tests for the content-script features live in [`Scaler++/tests`](tests/) and run on Node's built-in test runner with jsdom (no Jest):

```bash
cd Scaler++/tests
npm install      # one-time: installs jsdom
npm test         # runs the full suite
```

Coverage includes the string/DOM utilities, join-class time logic, custom-message selection, the Instructor Info tab/dashboard tagging, and the full **AI Lecture Summary** flow (cached render, Generate-button states, and the generate→cache path). A `smoke.test.js` loads the entire manifest content-script bundle in one scope and asserts every feature entrypoint is wired up — so newly added content scripts are covered automatically. See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for details.
